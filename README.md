## Introduce
This is a simple Clicker game AimLab style made by using Pygame only. Try to click 50 circles as fast as possible and check your time/accuracy for result. It will get progressively harder the longer you play.

## Installation
You need 2 package only: Pygame (of course) and Numpy. Type this into your command line to install:
```bash
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```

## Game rules
The game will get progressively harder as follow:

- 0 point: Circle appear for 1.25 secs
- 5 points: Circle appear for 1 sec
- 10 points: Circle appear for 0.75 sec
- 20, 30, 40 points: Circle will be smaller and smaller
- 50 points: You win!

You can press ESC to pause and check your score for every checkpoint. Pausing frequently enough, and you will find a way to cheat this game :wink:.

## Future update
Some feature that I can add to this game:

- A point system to evaluate based on time and accuracy
- More game mode (of course)
- Player custom mode

I'm not pleased with how the file is organized too. Might have to considerate and refactor it again.\
Thank everyone for taking a visit!
